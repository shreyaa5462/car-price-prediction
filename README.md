# Car Price Prediction Model

Hello Everyone! Welcome to the Car Price Prediction Model repository. This project focuses on predicting the price of cars using Linear Regression.

## Overview

Predicting the price of cars is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the automotive industry. Buyers can use accurate price predictions to make informed purchasing decisions, while sellers can optimize their pricing strategies to attract customers and maximize profits.

In this project, I have developed a Car Price Prediction model using Linear Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for regression tasks. I have trained the model on a dataset containing information about various car features such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and more.

## User Interface

To provide an interactive user experience, I have built a web-based interface using Streamlit. Streamlit allows users to input car features and get instant predictions of the car price based on my trained Linear Regression model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn (sklearn) library for machine learning
- Linear Regression model for prediction
- Streamlit for building the user interface

## Usage

To run the Car Price Prediction model locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run Main.py`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal to access the Car Price Prediction tool.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the Car Price Prediction model provides accurate predictions based on the available features, there are several avenues for improvement, including:

- Adding more features to the model to capture additional factors that influence car prices.
- Fine-tuning the model hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- Incorporating advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or deep learning for better performance.

## Feedback

I welcome feedback and suggestions for improving the Car Price Prediction model and user interface. If you have any questions, ideas, or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or reach out me.
